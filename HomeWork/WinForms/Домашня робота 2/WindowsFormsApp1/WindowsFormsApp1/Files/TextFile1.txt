Sport is an integral part of our life.
We live in a polluted world, that is why more and more people are concerned about their health and that is why more of them try to keep fit and start going in for sport.
Everybody, in my opinion, should do sports, especially, students.
As students spend a lot of time at school, sitting, it influences health badly.
Sport not only helps them to become strong and develop physically but also makes them more organized and better disciplined in their daily activities.
Sport plays an important role in people's life.
It is popular among the young and the old. Many people do morning exercises, go jogging or go to the gym.
Others prefer watching sports games on TV and listening to sports news rather than going in for sport.
I prefer doing sports rather than watching it.
For me watching it is very boring.
I do sports to keep myself fit.
So, to keep fit I like swimming, riding a bicycle, skating and skiing.
All these things I usually do with my family.
Also, I really like playing football, volleyball and basketball with my friends.
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is important for us to go in for sport, try to keep fit as we live in environmentally dangerous world.
